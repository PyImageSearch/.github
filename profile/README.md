## Who are we?

We at PyImageSearch are a bunch of **like-minded** people with the sole purpose of making Machine Learning and Deep Learning accessible and intuitive.

We create step-by-step [tutorials](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/blog) to help you understand the concepts and techniques, but we don't stop there. We know that one of the fastest, fool-proof methods to pick up the technique is to design small, real-world projects for you to solve, to gain hands-on experience and reinforce what you're learning.
